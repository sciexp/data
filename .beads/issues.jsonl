{"id":"data-a0y.1","title":"Research lakehouse-native columnar encoding for multimodal single-cell data","description":"Context: omicsio converts AnnData/MuData to columnar formats (vortex, parquet). The primary design question is how to optimally represent multimodal count/expression matrices in lakehouse table formats.\n\nTwo known approaches to evaluate:\n- X-Atlas-Orion list-column format: ~/projects/omicslake-workspace/X-Atlas-Orion\n- pqdata COO format: ~/projects/omicslake-workspace/pqdata\n\nTwo coupled questions:\n1. Lakehouse-native representation compatible with both parquet and vortex, building on X-Atlas-Orion and extending to multimodal data\n2. Rehydration to AnnData/MuData with Arrow as in-memory intermediate for out-of-core DuckDB processing\n\nUse cases to evaluate against:\n- Transcriptomic data with total RNA\n- RNA separated by spliced/unspliced\n- RNA separated by spliced/unspliced/ambiguous\n- Multimodal with ATAC-seq data (10x multiome format)\n- MuData structures with modalities of different dimensions\n\nDownstream consumers whose access patterns constrain the format:\n- pyrovelocity: ~/projects/pyrovelocity-workspace/pyrovelocity\n- stormi: ~/projects/pyrovelocity-workspace/stormi-review/stormi\n- hodosome: ~/projects/hodosome-workspace/hodosome\n\nReference documents in this repo:\n- docs/notes/omicsio/single-cell-data-architecture-for-queries-and-training.md\n- docs/notes/omicsio/single-cell-processing-pipeline-binseq-to-count-matrices.md\n- docs/notes/omicsio/pqdata-vs-xatlas-orion-schema-comparison.md\n\nContext files:\n- packages/omicsio/CLAUDE.md -\u003e ~/projects/sciexp/planning/contexts/omicsio.md\n\nStarting artifact: docs/notes/omicsio/research/columnar-encoding-for-multimodal-single-cell-data.md\n\nFirst round is reference-based research: survey local repos and docs to map the decision space. Output is a framing document capturing what is known, what remains open, and what experiments would resolve the open questions.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cameron.ray.smith@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-18T17:22:19.109095-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith","updated_at":"2026-02-18T17:22:40.340002-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"data-a0y.1","depends_on_id":"data-a0y","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-18T17:22:19.10975-05:00","created_by":"Cameron Smith"}]}
